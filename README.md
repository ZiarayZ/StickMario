# STICK MARIO
Stickman version of Mario. Uses Python and PyGame.
If you don't have Python and/or PyGame it can still be ran through the start.bat file.
If you do have Python and PyGame then you can run the python file "CompleteCode.pyw" with the python interpreter.
Less finicky when editing the program.
