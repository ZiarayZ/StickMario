# STICK MARIO
Stickman version of Mario. Uses Python and PyGame.<br />
If you do have Python and PyGame then you can run the python file "CompleteCode.pyw" with the python interpreter.<br />
Feel Free to change things, it is terribly optimised currently.<br />
I made the mistake of implementing realtime instead of using frames.<br />
I may come back to edit and optimise this at a later time.<br />
